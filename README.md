# customer_segment

A simple web application for exploring various clustering models to cluster customers based on features. Users can further tune the hyperparameters in these models to observe changes in the results and view a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the data provided. Current machine learning algorithms available in the app include:

- K-Means Clustering
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- Spectral Clustering
